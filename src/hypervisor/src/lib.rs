//! Host hypervisor backends. The [`Vm`] and [`Vcpu`] traits are the contract
//! every backend implements. [`kvm`] implements them on Linux; vCPU register
//! access and the HVF and WHP backends are not implemented yet.
//!
//! This crate owns host-specific mechanisms; `boxlite-vmm` owns the guest
//! machine configuration, memory backing, execution policy, and devices.
//!
//! Backends are selected at compile time rather than dispatched at run time,
//! since no host has more than one of HVF, KVM and WHP.
